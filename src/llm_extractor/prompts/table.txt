### Example

### Output Format
You must only output as a list of JSON dictionaries, where each dictionary corresponds to a row in the table.
Each key represents a column header, and each value is the corresponding cell value for that row.

Make sure the output is a valid JSON object. No additional text, explanations, or thinking.

### Key Instructions

- Extract the table exactly as it appears in the source text, without any modifications, corrections, or assumptions.

- Observe the structure of the table in the image carefully, and make sure only that structure is followed in your output.

- If the user has provided ### UNSTRUCTURED TEXT, leverage it to cross check your extracted data from the image.

- Do not generate any additional text, explanations, or information. Output only the JSON object.

- Maintain the original structure, values, and format from the source text.

- Ensure no hallucinated values are created. The output must be an exact, truthful, and accurate representation of the source table.

- If a table spans multiple pages, you should merge them into a single table.

- If the said table is not present in the source, return an empty json array: []
